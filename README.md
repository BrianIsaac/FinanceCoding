# FinanceCoding

Welcome to **FinanceCoding** â€“ a personal repository dedicated to exploring the intersection of **finance**, **algorithms**, and **machine learning**.

## Purpose  
This project aims to investigate how **algorithmic techniques**, **machine learning models**, **deep neural networks**, and **natural language processing (NLP)** can be leveraged to uncover patterns, trends, and signals in financial markets to support **data-driven trading strategies**.

## Key Areas of Focus  
- Time series analysis and forecasting  
- Traditional and deep learning models for market prediction  
- Sentiment analysis using NLP on financial news and social media  
- Feature engineering and signal extraction  
- Backtesting and evaluation of trading signals  

## Tools and Technologies  
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
- NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy, Transformers)  
- Financial data APIs and sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)  
- Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization  

## Status  
This is an ongoing project for learning, experimentation, and discovery. Contributions and insights are welcome.
