## Investment Recommendation

### Deployment Strategy

**Phase 1: Pilot Implementation (3-6 months)**
- Initial allocation: 10-25% of target portfolio
- Real-time performance tracking vs. benchmark
- Transaction cost validation
- Risk management system integration

**Phase 2: Scale-Up (6-12 months)**
- Gradual increase to target allocation based on performance
- Full operational integration
- Comprehensive reporting and monitoring

**Phase 3: Full Deployment (12+ months)**
- Complete strategy implementation
- Ongoing optimisation and enhancement
- Regular performance review and adjustment

### Success Criteria
- Sharpe ratio ≥1.2 (20% margin below backtested)
- Maximum drawdown ≤-30%
- Information ratio ≥0.15
- Annual turnover ≤2.0x
