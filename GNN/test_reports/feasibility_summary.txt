STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
========================
1. BALANCED APPROACH: HRP offers optimal feasibility vs performance trade-off
2. COST OPTIMIZATION: HRP provides best TCO for cost-conscious deployment
3. RAPID DEPLOYMENT: HRP enables fastest time-to-value

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES
========================
1. IMMEDIATE: Begin planning for HRP implementation
2. BUDGET PLANNING: Allocate $912,419 - $1,239,561 for 3-year deployment
3. RESOURCE ALLOCATION: Plan for 12.5 - 15.3 month implementation

RISK CONSIDERATIONS
==================
• Complexity ranges from 37.1 to 69.0 (0-100 scale)
• Timeline risks include technical complexity and organizational factors
• Cost risks include computational scaling and maintenance requirements
