## Document Organization Rationale

The documentation has been organized following the technical architecture's directory structure to create logical groupings:

- **Root Level**: Core project documents that all stakeholders need to reference
- **tutorials/**: Step-by-step guides for developers and users  
- **research/**: Detailed technical specifications for ML model implementations
- **deployment/**: Setup, configuration, and operational procedures
- **api/**: Technical API reference and integration documentation
