# Next Steps

## Architect Prompt
"Please review the attached PRD for the Portfolio Optimization with Machine Learning Techniques project and create the technical architecture. Focus on: 1) Monorepo structure optimization for research workflow, 2) GPU memory management for GAT/LSTM training within 12GB constraints, 3) Data pipeline architecture for efficient parquet-based storage and retrieval, 4) Model training orchestration supporting rolling backtests with proper validation splits. The existing GAT implementation should serve as the architectural foundation."
