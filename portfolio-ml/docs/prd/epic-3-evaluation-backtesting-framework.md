# Epic 3: Evaluation & Backtesting Framework

**Epic Goal:** Build comprehensive rolling backtest engine with rigorous performance analytics, statistical validation, and comparison framework. This epic delivers the academic validation infrastructure that transforms individual model implementations into systematic research with statistically significant conclusions.

## Story 3.1: Rolling Backtest Engine Implementation

As a **quantitative researcher**,  
I want **rolling backtest engine with strict no-look-ahead validation**,  
so that **performance evaluation mirrors realistic deployment conditions and avoids data snooping**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Rolling window implementation maintains 36-month training / 12-month validation / 12-month testing protocol
2. Walk-forward analysis advances monthly with proper data isolation between periods
3. Model retraining automation handles changing universe membership and missing data
4. Temporal data integrity prevents any future information leakage into model training
5. Backtest execution tracks all portfolio positions, trades, and performance metrics over time
6. Memory management handles full evaluation period (2016-2024) within computational constraints

## Story 3.2: Performance Analytics and Risk Metrics

As a **portfolio manager**,  
I want **comprehensive performance and risk analytics across all approaches**,  
so that **I can evaluate risk-adjusted returns and operational characteristics for institutional deployment**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Core performance metrics: Sharpe ratio, CAGR, maximum drawdown, volatility, total return
2. Risk analytics: tracking error vs S&P MidCap 400, Information Ratio, win rate, downside deviation
3. Operational metrics: average monthly turnover, implementation shortfall, constraint compliance
4. Rolling performance analysis with time-varying metrics and regime identification
5. Performance attribution analysis isolating alpha generation vs beta exposure
6. Benchmark comparison framework including equal-weight and mean-variance baselines

## Story 3.3: Statistical Significance Testing

As a **academic researcher**,  
I want **rigorous statistical validation of performance differences**,  
so that **research conclusions meet academic standards and identify genuinely superior approaches**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Sharpe ratio statistical significance testing using asymptotic and bootstrap methods
2. Multiple comparison corrections account for testing three ML approaches simultaneously
3. Rolling window consistency analysis measures performance stability across time periods
4. Confidence intervals calculated for all key performance metrics
5. Hypothesis testing framework validates ≥0.2 Sharpe ratio improvement claims
6. Publication-ready statistical summary tables with p-values and effect sizes

## Story 3.4: Comparative Analysis and Visualization

As a **portfolio manager**,  
I want **clear comparative analysis with intuitive visualizations**,  
so that **I can understand which approaches work best and under what conditions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Performance comparison tables ranking all approaches by key metrics
2. Time series plots showing cumulative returns and drawdown periods across methods
3. Risk-return scatter plots positioning each approach in Sharpe ratio vs volatility space
4. Monthly performance heat maps identifying strong and weak periods for each model
5. Turnover and transaction cost analysis comparing operational efficiency
6. Regime analysis showing performance during different market conditions (bull, bear, sideways)

## Story 3.5: Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis

As a **risk analyst**,  
I want **robustness testing across different parameter configurations**,  
so that **results are stable and not dependent on arbitrary modeling choices**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for all ML approaches across reasonable ranges
2. Transaction cost sensitivity testing (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%) impacts on relative performance
3. Top-k portfolio size analysis comparing performance across k ∈ {20, 30, 50, 75, 100}
4. Graph construction method comparison for GAT (k-NN vs MST vs TMFG)
5. Lookback window sensitivity for LSTM (30, 45, 60, 90 days)
6. Constraint violation frequency analysis and performance impact assessment
