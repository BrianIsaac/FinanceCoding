# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

• Achieve annualized Sharpe ratio improvement of ≥0.2 over equal-weight baseline across all ML approaches
• Demonstrate systematic framework for evaluating three ML portfolio allocation approaches (HRP, LSTM, GAT)
• Maintain operational feasibility with monthly turnover ≤20% and transaction cost considerations
• Deliver production-ready framework for institutional portfolio managers
• Show consistent outperformance across 75% of rolling evaluation windows (2016-2024)
• Complete end-to-end pipeline processing within acceptable computational time limits (<4 hours monthly)

## Background Context

Traditional portfolio optimization suffers from critical limitations including estimation errors in mean-variance models, sensitivity to input parameters, and failure to capture evolving market relationships. This project addresses these challenges by implementing a systematic framework to evaluate three advanced machine learning approaches for US mid-cap equity allocation: Hierarchical Risk Parity for clustering-aware allocation, LSTM networks for temporal pattern recognition, and Graph Attention Networks for relationship-aware portfolio construction. The framework targets institutional portfolio managers seeking improved risk-adjusted returns while maintaining operational feasibility and avoiding the pitfalls of classical Modern Portfolio Theory.
