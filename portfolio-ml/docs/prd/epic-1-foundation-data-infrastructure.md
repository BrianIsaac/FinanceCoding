**Key Production Metrics:**
- Universe Coverage: 822/822 tickers (100% target achievement)
- Data Quality: 480 tickers with >95% coverage (58.4% of universe)
- Date Range: 2010-01-04 to 2024-12-30 (3,773 trading days)
- Storage Efficiency: 38.2MB total (prices: 9.8MB, volume: 9.4MB, returns: 19MB)
- Gap Filling Success: 2,022 gaps processed with volume validation

## Story 1.1: Project Structure Setup and Environment Configuration

As a **developer**,  
I want **organized project structure with proper Python environment setup**,  
so that **all components have clear locations and dependencies are managed consistently**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure created with src/models/, src/preprocessing/, src/evaluation/, src/utils/, and data/ directories
2. uv environment configured with all required dependencies (PyTorch, scikit-learn, NetworkX, pandas, numpy)
3. GPU acceleration verified with CUDA-enabled PyTorch on RTX GeForce 5070Ti
4. Basic import structure functional across all modules with proper Python path configuration
5. Google-style docstring template and type hinting standards documented and implemented

## Story 1.2: S&P MidCap 400 Dynamic Universe Construction ✅ COMPLETED

As a **quantitative researcher**,  
I want **historically accurate S&P MidCap 400 membership data from 2016-2024**,  
so that **portfolio backtests avoid survivorship bias and reflect realistic index dynamics**.

### Acceptance Criteria ✅ ALL SATISFIED
1. ✅ Wikipedia scraping module extracts S&P MidCap 400 historical membership changes with dates
2. ✅ Universe construction handles additions, deletions, and ticker changes over evaluation period
3. ✅ Monthly universe snapshots generated for each rebalancing date from 2016-2024
4. ✅ Survivorship bias validation confirms deceased/delisted companies included in historical periods
5. ✅ Data quality checks verify minimum 400 constituents maintained across time periods

**Production Results:** Successfully constructed dynamic universe with 822 unique tickers across full historical period with modular architecture enabling 100% target coverage in production pipeline.

## Story 1.3: Multi-Source Data Pipeline with Gap Filling ✅ COMPLETED

As a **portfolio manager**,  
I want **clean, gap-filled daily price and volume data from Stooq and Yahoo Finance**,  
so that **ML models train on consistent, high-quality datasets without missing data artifacts**.

### Acceptance Criteria ✅ ALL SATISFIED
1. ✅ Stooq integration retrieves daily OHLCV data for all S&P MidCap 400 constituents
2. ✅ Yahoo Finance fallback handles data gaps and provides missing historical periods
3. ✅ Gap-filling algorithm interpolates missing prices using forward/backward fill with volume validation
4. ✅ Data normalization produces clean daily returns and adjusted volume panels
5. ✅ Parquet storage format optimized for efficient loading during model training and backtesting
6. ✅ Data quality validation reports identify and flag problematic securities or time periods

**Production Results:** Achieved 822/822 ticker coverage with YFinance collector, processed 2,022 data gaps, generated optimized parquet datasets with 69.9% average coverage and comprehensive quality validation scoring 0.865.

## Story 1.4: Basic Portfolio Construction Framework

As a **portfolio manager**,  
I want **equal-weight baseline portfolio implementation with constraint system**,  
so that **I have immediate working portfolio functionality and ML comparison baseline**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Equal-weight allocation function distributes capital across top-k securities (k ∈ {20, 30, 50, 75, 100})
2. Long-only constraint enforcement prevents short positions
3. Monthly rebalancing logic maintains target weights within turnover limits
4. Linear transaction cost model (0.1% per trade) integrated into portfolio performance calculations
5. Basic performance metrics calculated: total return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown
6. Portfolio position export functionality for analysis and verification
