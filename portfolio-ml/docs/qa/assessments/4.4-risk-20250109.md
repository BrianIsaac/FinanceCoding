## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Complex Multi-Model Integration Failure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Integrating GAT, LSTM, and HRP interpretability mechanisms with different APIs and data structures
**Impact**: High (3) - Complete interpretability framework failure, regulatory compliance violations, inability to explain model decisions
**Affected Components**: 
- GAT attention extraction (`src/evaluation/interpretability/gat_explainer.py`)

**Testing Focus**: End-to-end integration testing with all three model types, error scenario testing, fallback mechanism validation

### 2. BUS-001: Misleading Interpretability Results

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex ML interpretability methods (SHAP, attention analysis) can produce incorrect attributions
**Impact**: High (3) - Incorrect investment decisions, regulatory compliance violations, client trust loss
**Affected Components**:
- SHAP analysis implementation (`src/evaluation/interpretability/portfolio_explainer.py`)

- **TECH-002**: Attention extraction can proceed with documented model compatibility matrix
- **BUS-002**: Regulatory compliance can be addressed with enhanced documentation
- **TECH-003**: Visualization bottlenecks acceptable with performance monitoring

### Accepted Risks

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Memory Usage**: SHAP analysis and visualization generation memory consumption
- **Performance Metrics**: Explanation generation latency and throughput
- **Error Rates**: Model integration failures and explanation generation errors
- **Business KPIs**: Client satisfaction with explanation quality and regulatory audit outcomes

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New interpretability methods added (LIME, integrated gradients)
- Model architectures change significantly
- Regulatory requirements for explanations updated
- Client feedback indicates explanation quality issues
- Performance bottlenecks identified in production

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### 1. Testing Priority

- **Feature Flags**: Enable interpretability features incrementally
- **Rollback**: Maintain fallback to basic portfolio reporting without explanations

### 4. Monitoring Setup
