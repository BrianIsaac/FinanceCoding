## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**BUS-001 Strategic Analysis Validation**:
- Multi-source validation of performance gap analysis
- Scenario modeling with sensitivity analysis
- Business case calculation verification with multiple methodologies
- Expert review validation for strategic recommendations

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**BUS-002 Market Assessment Testing**:
- Competitive analysis validation against multiple market research sources
- Market sizing calculations with confidence intervals
- Customer needs assessment verification through surveys or interviews

**TECH-001 Technology Feasibility Testing**:
- Technical architecture feasibility validation with proof-of-concept implementations
- Resource requirement estimation validation through pilot projects
- Integration complexity assessment with existing systems

**BUS-003 Commercial Model Testing**:
- Revenue projection validation with multiple pricing scenarios
- Business model assumption testing with market research
- Go-to-market strategy validation through customer discovery

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Scalability and Performance Testing**:
- Mathematical validation of scaling formulas
- Resource projection testing with benchmark data
- Performance target validation against industry standards

**Documentation and Process Testing**:
- Documentation completeness validation
- Strategic planning process effectiveness testing
- Stakeholder alignment verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Implementation

- **BUS-001**: Strategic analysis must be validated through multiple sources and expert review
- **BUS-002**: Market assessment must include competitive intelligence and customer validation
- **TECH-001**: Technology feasibility must be validated through proof-of-concept implementations

### Can Proceed with Mitigation

- **TECH-002**: Scalability projections can proceed with conservative estimates and regular updates
- **DATA-001**: Performance benchmarking can proceed with available data and identified gaps
- **OPS-001**: Strategic planning process can improve iteratively with stakeholder feedback

### Accepted Risks

- **BUS-004**: Research collaboration framework can evolve based on initial partnership experiences
- **TECH-003**: Documentation quality can improve through iterative feedback and updates
- **OPS-002**: Timeline accuracy can be refined through experience and regular updates

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-implementation monitoring for:

- **Strategic Decisions**: Track alignment between strategic recommendations and actual implementation outcomes
- **Market Accuracy**: Monitor market evolution against predictions and competitive landscape changes  
- **Technology Feasibility**: Track technology upgrade implementation success and resource consumption
- **Business Performance**: Monitor commercial model performance against projections

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Market conditions change significantly (new competitors, regulatory changes)
- Technology landscape evolves (new ML techniques, cloud capabilities)
- Business model assumptions prove incorrect
- Strategic partnerships or collaborations change
- Performance benchmarks or competitive landscape shifts

## Risk-Based Recommendations
