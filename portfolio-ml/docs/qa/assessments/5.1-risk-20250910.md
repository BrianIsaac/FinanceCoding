Date: 2025-09-10
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 1  
- Risk Score: 70/100 (Low-Medium Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-003: Temporal Integrity Violations

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Complex temporal alignment across dynamic universe with membership changes
**Impact**: High - Look-ahead bias would invalidate ML model results and compromise research validity
**Mitigation**:

- Implement strict temporal validation in universe calendar integration
- Add automated look-ahead bias detection in data pipeline
- Create comprehensive temporal integrity test suite for all training periods
- Document temporal alignment procedures and validation checks
**Testing Focus**: Look-ahead bias prevention tests, temporal alignment validation, universe membership transition testing

## High Risks Requiring Mitigation

### 1. PERF-004: Memory Exhaustion During Large-Scale Processing

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Processing 8+ years × 400+ securities with daily OHLCV data
**Impact**: Medium - Pipeline execution failures, system instability, but recoverable
**Mitigation**:

- Implement memory-efficient data processing with chunking strategies
- Add system resource monitoring during pipeline execution
- Create memory optimization for parquet generation and gap-filling
- Establish processing checkpoints for large dataset handling
**Testing Focus**: Memory stress testing, large-scale data processing validation, system resource monitoring

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Category | Title | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Owner | Timeline |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|------------------|----------|
| DATA-003 | Data | Temporal integrity violations | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Dev Team | During development |
| PERF-004 | Performance | Memory exhaustion | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | Dev Team | During testing |
| OPS-005 | Operational | Wikipedia scraping reliability | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Dev Team | During execution |
| TECH-002 | Technical | Open source API reliability | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Dev Team | During execution |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Data Coverage Validation**: Test >95% availability requirement across all securities/periods
- **API Failure Recovery**: Simulate rate limiting, network failures, service outages
- **Fallback Chain Testing**: Validate Stooq → Yahoo Finance → manual intervention flow
- **Large-Scale Data Processing**: Test memory usage patterns during full pipeline execution

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Temporal Integrity Tests**: Validate look-ahead bias prevention across training periods
- **Memory Stress Tests**: Test processing with maximum expected data volumes
- **Business Day Alignment**: Test holiday calendar integration and temporal alignment

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests

- **Wikipedia Scraping**: Test scraper resilience to website structure changes
- **Gap-Filling Accuracy**: Validate forward/backward fill and interpolation methods
- **Parquet Generation**: Test schema validation, partitioning, and compression

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **Critical temporal integrity risk (DATA-003) must be mitigated**
- **Automated look-ahead bias detection required**
- **Comprehensive temporal validation test suite needed**

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- High performance risk (PERF-004) with memory monitoring and chunking strategies
- Medium risks with documented workarounds and fallback procedures

### Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Data Quality Metrics**: Coverage percentages, gap frequencies, quality scores
- **API Performance**: Request rates, failure counts, retry success rates
- **System Resources**: Memory usage, processing times, storage utilization
- **Pipeline Health**: Execution success rates, error frequencies, validation results

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Gate Decision Logic:**
- 1 Critical Risk (score 9) → Gate = CONCERNS (requires mitigation)  
- Must implement temporal integrity validation before proceeding with ML model training

**Recommendations:**
- **Must Fix**: Implement automated look-ahead bias detection and temporal integrity validation
- **Monitor**: System memory usage during large-scale processing, data quality metrics
