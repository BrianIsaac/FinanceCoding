### Critical Gaps

#### 1. Integration Testing Coverage
- **Gap**: No integration tests found for end-to-end interpretability pipeline
- **Risk**: High - Individual components may not work together properly
- **Action**: Create integration tests in `tests/integration/test_interpretability_framework.py`

#### 2. Performance Testing for Large Datasets
- **Gap**: No performance tests for interpretability analysis on large portfolios
- **Risk**: Medium - Could be slow on production-scale data
- **Action**: Add performance benchmarks for analysis with 1000+ assets

#### 3. Visualization Rendering Tests
- **Gap**: Limited testing of actual chart generation and interactivity
- **Risk**: Medium - Charts may not render correctly in different environments
- **Action**: Add tests for plotly chart generation and JavaScript interactivity

#### 4. Error Handling Under Edge Conditions
- **Gap**: Limited testing of behavior with malformed model outputs
- **Risk**: Medium - Could crash when models produce unexpected outputs
- **Action**: Add comprehensive edge case testing

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Integration Test Suite**
   - End-to-end interpretability pipeline tests
   - Cross-model integration testing
   - Dashboard generation testing

2. **Performance Test Suite**
   - Large dataset performance benchmarks
   - Memory usage profiling for SHAP analysis
   - Visualization rendering performance

3. **Edge Case Test Expansion**
   - Malformed model output handling
   - Missing data scenarios
   - Invalid configuration handling

4. **Visual Regression Testing**
   - Chart appearance consistency
   - Interactive element functionality
   - Cross-browser compatibility

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Integration gaps (no end-to-end testing)
- **Medium Risk**: Performance unknowns, visualization edge cases
- **Low Risk**: Individual component functionality (well tested)

✅ Every AC has comprehensive test coverage  
✅ Critical model interpretability paths have multiple test levels  
✅ Edge cases are covered in unit tests
