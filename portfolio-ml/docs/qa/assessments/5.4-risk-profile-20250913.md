## Detailed Risk Analysis

### 游댮 HIGH RISK: Statistical Accuracy and Methodology

**Risk Description:**
Implementation of complex statistical methods (Jobson-Korkie test, bootstrap confidence intervals, multiple comparison corrections) with potential for mathematical errors or misinterpretation.

**Probability:** High (70%)
- Complex mathematical implementations prone to subtle errors
- Multiple statistical frameworks requiring precise implementation
- Academic-grade requirements with strict validation needs

**Impact:** Critical
- Incorrect statistical conclusions could invalidate research findings
- Academic reputation and publication potential at stake
- Financial decision-making based on flawed statistical analysis

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Reference Implementation Validation**
   - Cross-validate against scipy.stats and R statistical packages
   - Implement unit tests with known statistical distributions
   - Create reference datasets with known expected outcomes

2. **Academic Review Process**
   - External statistical methodology review
   - Peer validation of statistical implementations
   - Documentation of all statistical assumptions and limitations

3. **Comprehensive Testing Framework**
   - Statistical accuracy tests with tolerance specifications
   - Bootstrap procedure validation against theoretical distributions
   - Monte Carlo validation of confidence interval coverage

### 游리 MEDIUM RISK: Computational Resource Constraints

**Risk Description:**
Processing 96 evaluation periods with 10,000 bootstrap samples per metric across multiple ML approaches may exceed GPU memory limits or processing time constraints.

**Probability:** Medium (50%)
- Large-scale statistical computations with memory requirements
- GPU memory constraints (11GB limit) for batch processing
- Extended processing times for comprehensive statistical analysis

**Impact:** High
- Potential system crashes or memory overflow errors
- Extended execution times affecting development timeline
- Incomplete analysis due to resource limitations

**Mitigation Strategies:**

   - Progressive result storage to prevent memory accumulation

2. **Scalable Processing Architecture**
   - Implement checkpointing for long-running statistical procedures
   - Design for parallel processing where possible
   - Create memory usage monitoring and automatic cleanup

3. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Memory profiling for statistical computation pipelines
   - Execution time estimation and optimization
   - Resource usage validation within hardware constraints

### 游리 MEDIUM RISK: Academic Compliance and Publication Standards

**Risk Description:**
Ensuring statistical methodology meets academic publication standards with proper APA formatting, complete statistical disclosure, and reproducible results.

**Probability:** Medium (40%)
- Complex formatting requirements for academic publications
- Potential gaps in statistical reporting completeness
- Reproducibility challenges across different environments

**Impact:** High
- Research results may not meet publication standards
- Academic credibility and peer review acceptance at risk
- Potential requirement for significant rework

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Academic Standards Framework**
   - Implement comprehensive statistical reporting templates
   - Create automated compliance checking for APA formatting
