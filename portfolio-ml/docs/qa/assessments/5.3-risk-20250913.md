Date: 2025-09-13
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 73/100 (moderate risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Memory Exhaustion During 8-Year Backtesting

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - 8-year dataset with multiple models, 96 evaluation periods, and â‰¤11GB GPU memory constraint creates high likelihood of memory exhaustion
**Impact**: High - System crashes or incomplete results would invalidate entire research study
**Mitigation**:

- Implement progressive checkpoint saving every 12 windows
- Add memory monitoring with automatic cleanup triggers at 9GB threshold
- Design batch processing with configurable memory limits
- Implement fallback to CPU processing for memory-constrained operations
- Add graceful degradation with reduced batch sizes

**Testing Focus**: Memory stress testing with full-scale data simulation, GPU memory monitoring during extended runs

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Memory Stress Testing**: Simulate full 8-year backtest with memory monitoring
- **Checkpoint Recovery Testing**: Validate ability to resume from checkpoint after memory failure
- **Memory Limit Testing**: Test graceful degradation at 11GB GPU memory threshold
- **Long-Running Stability**: 24-hour continuous execution test with memory tracking

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Performance Benchmarking**: Validate 8-hour execution target with scaled datasets
- **Temporal Integrity Testing**: Comprehensive validation of no-look-ahead bias
- **Parallel Processing Testing**: Validate independent model evaluation parallelization
- **Data Leakage Detection**: Automated temporal bias detection across all windows

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Model Serialization Testing**: Validate checkpoint consistency across model types
- **Statistical Validation Testing**: Verify academic publication standard compliance
- **Error Recovery Testing**: Test system behavior under various failure modes

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **TECH-001**: Memory exhaustion (score 9) - Implement comprehensive memory management
- **DATA-001**: Temporal data leakage (score 6) - Add automated validation

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **PERF-001**: Execution time (score 6) - With performance monitoring and parallel processing
- **TECH-002**: Model loading issues (score 4) - With retry mechanisms and validation

### Accepted Risks

- **BUS-001**: Academic standards (score 3) - Well-established methodologies reduce risk
- **PERF-002**: Memory fragmentation (score 4) - Monitoring and cleanup procedures adequate

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Memory Usage**: Real-time GPU memory tracking with 9GB alerts
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time tracking against 8-hour target
- **Data Integrity**: Temporal validation checkpoints for each rolling window
- **System Health**: GPU temperature, memory fragmentation metrics
- **Result Quality**: Statistical validation against expected academic standards

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Memory constraints change (GPU upgrade/downgrade)
- Dataset size increases beyond current 8-year scope
- New model architectures added requiring different memory profiles
- Performance targets change (execution time requirements)
- Academic validation standards evolve
- GPU hardware compatibility issues discovered

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### 1. Testing Priority
- Run memory stress tests first with full dataset simulation
- Validate temporal integrity before extended execution
- Performance benchmark with scaled datasets before production runs
- Test checkpoint recovery mechanisms under various failure scenarios

### 2. Development Focus
- Implement robust memory monitoring and cleanup
- Add comprehensive temporal validation automation
- Optimize batch processing for memory efficiency
- Implement graceful degradation for resource constraints

### 3. Deployment Strategy
- Phased rollout starting with smaller evaluation periods
- Implement feature flags for memory management strategies
- Maintain fallback procedures to CPU processing
- Prepare rollback procedures for checkpoint-based recovery

### 4. Monitoring Setup
- Real-time GPU memory usage dashboards
- Execution progress tracking with time estimates
- Temporal integrity validation alerts
- System resource health monitoring
