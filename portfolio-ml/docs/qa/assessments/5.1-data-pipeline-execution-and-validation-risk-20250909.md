## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### DATA-002: Historical Data Quality Risk

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Historical financial data commonly contains gaps, errors, corporate action misalignments, and membership inaccuracies that can significantly impact ML model training validity.

**Impact**: High - Poor data quality would invalidate all downstream ML model training, backtesting results, and research conclusions, potentially requiring complete re-execution of Epic 5.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement cross-validation against multiple data sources for critical periods
- Add comprehensive statistical outlier detection with configurable thresholds
- Manual spot-checking of known market events (2008 crisis, COVID-19 periods)
- Implement data lineage tracking for audit trail
- Add early warning systems for data quality degradation

**Testing Focus**: 
- Synthetic data corruption scenarios
- Known market event validation (March 2020, dot-com crash)
- Cross-source data consistency validation
- Statistical distribution validation across time periods

## High Risks Requiring Mitigation

### DATA-001: Data Source Availability Risk (Score: 6)

**Probability**: Medium - API rate limiting, downtime, or service degradation during 8-year historical data collection

**Impact**: High - Complete pipeline execution failure, blocking all subsequent Epic 5 stories

**Mitigation**:
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Multiple fallback data sources beyond Yahoo Finance
- Checkpoint/resume capability for large collection jobs

### DATA-003: Look-Ahead Bias Risk (Score: 6)

**Probability**: Medium - Complex temporal alignment logic with universe membership changes and data availability

**Impact**: High - Research invalidation, regulatory compliance issues, academic credibility loss

**Mitigation**:
- Rigorous unit tests for temporal boundary conditions
- Independent code review focusing on time-series logic
- Validation against known universe membership change dates
- Automated bias detection algorithms

### OPS-001: Runtime Performance Risk (Score: 6)

**Probability**: High - First full execution of 8-year, 400-security pipeline under performance constraints

**Impact**: Medium - Schedule delays for Epic 5, potential infrastructure scaling needs

**Mitigation**:
- Performance benchmarking on representative data subsets
- Parallel processing implementation where feasible
- Memory usage profiling and optimization
- Fallback to cloud-based processing if local constraints exceeded

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**DATA-002 Mitigation Tests:**
- Historical membership accuracy validation against known S&P changes
- Price data consistency across multiple date ranges
- Corporate action handling validation (splits, dividends, mergers)
- Statistical outlier detection with known market anomalies
- Data lineage and provenance tracking validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**DATA-001 Tests:**
- API failure simulation and recovery testing
- Rate limiting behavior and backoff logic validation
- Fallback data source activation and quality comparison
- Resume-from-checkpoint functionality testing

**DATA-003 Tests:**
- Temporal boundary validation for training/validation splits
- Universe membership change alignment with data availability
- Look-ahead bias detection algorithms
- Time-series alignment validation across rebalance dates

**OPS-001 Tests:**
- Full pipeline performance benchmarking
- Memory usage profiling under maximum load
- Parallel processing effectiveness measurement
- Scale testing with S&P 500 universe size

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Parquet schema validation and evolution testing
- Compression and storage optimization validation
- Standard functional tests for gap-filling algorithms
- Configuration management and YAML parsing tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **DATA-002**: Critical data quality validation must be implemented and validated
- **DATA-001**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms required
- **DATA-003**: Look-ahead bias prevention must be thoroughly tested and validated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **OPS-001**: Performance optimization with monitoring and alerting
- **PERF-001**: Memory monitoring with graceful degradation

### Accepted Risks

- **TECH-001**: Low probability schema evolution issues with manual intervention capability

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Data Quality Metrics**: Coverage percentages, outlier detection rates, cross-source consistency scores
- **Performance Metrics**: Pipeline execution time, memory usage peaks, API response times
- **Error Rates**: Collection failures, gap-filling frequency, validation failures
- **Business KPIs**: Dataset completeness, ML training data quality scores

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Data source API terms or rate limits change
- Historical data requirements extend to additional time periods
- Universe composition changes significantly (S&P methodology updates)
- Performance requirements become more stringent
- New data quality issues discovered during execution
- ML model training reveals systematic data quality problems

## Risk Score Calculation

```
Base Score: 100
DATA-002 (Critical): -20 points = 80
DATA-001 (High): -10 points = 70  
DATA-003 (High): -10 points = 60
OPS-001 (High): -10 points = 50
PERF-001 (Medium): -5 points = 45
TECH-001 (Low): -2 points = 43

Adjusted for mitigation strategies: +21 points = 64/100
```

**Final Risk Assessment: MODERATE RISK** - Requires focused attention on data quality validation and robust error handling, but manageable with proper mitigation strategies.
