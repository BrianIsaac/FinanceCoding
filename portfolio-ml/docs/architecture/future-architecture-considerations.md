## Scalability Roadmap

**Phase 2a: Enhanced Models (Months 6-9)**
- Transformer-based sequence models for return prediction
- Ensemble methods combining HRP, LSTM, and GAT predictions
- Reinforcement learning for dynamic portfolio allocation
- Advanced attention mechanisms for asset relationship modeling

**Phase 2b: Expanded Coverage (Months 9-12)**
- International developed market support (European, Asian equities)
- Multi-asset allocation (equities, bonds, commodities, alternatives)
- Alternative data integration (satellite, sentiment, supply chain)
- Sector-specific and thematic portfolio construction

**Phase 3: Production Platform (Months 12-18)**
- Cloud-native deployment on AWS/GCP with auto-scaling
- Real-time market data integration via Bloomberg/Refinitiv APIs
- RESTful API service layer for institutional client integration
- Advanced risk management with real-time monitoring and alerts
