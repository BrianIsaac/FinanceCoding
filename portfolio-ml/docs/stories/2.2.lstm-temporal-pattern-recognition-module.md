### LSTM Architecture Requirements
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#lstm-temporal-network-architecture]

**Core LSTM Implementation Pattern:**
```python
class LSTMPortfolioModel(PortfolioModel):
    def __init__(self, 
                 constraints: PortfolioConstraints,
                 sequence_length: int = 60,          # 60-day lookback
                 hidden_size: int = 128,            # LSTM hidden dimensions
                 num_layers: int = 2,               # Stacked LSTM layers
                 dropout: float = 0.3):
        
    class LSTMNetwork(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, 
                     input_size: int,               # Number of features per asset
                     hidden_size: int, 
                     num_layers: int,
                     output_size: int,              # Forecast horizon
                     dropout: float):
            super().__init__()
            self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, 
                              dropout=dropout, batch_first=True)
            self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(hidden_size, num_heads=8)
            self.output_projection = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
```

**Key LSTM Features Requirements:**
- **Sequence Modeling**: 60-day rolling windows capture temporal patterns
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Focus on relevant historical periods  
- **Regularization**: Dropout and batch normalization prevent overfitting
- **GPU Optimization**: Batch processing within 12GB VRAM constraints

                 model: nn.Module,
                 max_memory_gb: float = 11.0,
                 gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 4):

        self.accumulation_steps = gradient_accumulation_steps
        self.scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()  # Mixed precision
```

**Training Strategy with Memory Constraints:**

def train_lstm_model(model: LSTMNetwork, 
                    data_loader: DataLoader,
                    validation_loader: DataLoader,

- **Sequence Construction**: Create 60-day rolling windows with proper validation splits

### Technical Specifications

**LSTM Network Configuration** [Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#lstm-temporal-network-architecture]:
```python
@dataclass
class LSTMConfig:
    sequence_length: int = 60                       # 60-day lookback window
    hidden_size: int = 128                         # LSTM hidden dimensions
    num_layers: int = 2                            # Stacked LSTM layers
    dropout: float = 0.3                           # Regularization
    num_attention_heads: int = 8                   # Multi-head attention
    learning_rate: float = 0.001                   # Adam optimizer learning rate
    weight_decay: float = 1e-5                     # L2 regularization
    batch_size: int = 32                           # Training batch size
    epochs: int = 100                              # Maximum training epochs
    patience: int = 15                             # Early stopping patience
```

**Sequence Data Processing:**
```python
def create_sequences(returns_data: pd.DataFrame, 
                    sequence_length: int = 60) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
    """Create overlapping sequences for LSTM training."""
    # Returns shape: (n_samples, sequence_length, n_features)
    # Targets shape: (n_samples, n_features) for next-month returns
```

**Custom Loss Function for Portfolio Optimization:**
```python
class SharpeRatioLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, risk_free_rate: float = 0.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.risk_free_rate = risk_free_rate
    
    def forward(self, predicted_returns: torch.Tensor, 
                actual_returns: torch.Tensor,
                portfolio_weights: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Compute negative Sharpe ratio as loss for direct optimization."""
        portfolio_returns = (portfolio_weights * actual_returns).sum(dim=1)
        excess_returns = portfolio_returns - self.risk_free_rate
        sharpe_ratio = excess_returns.mean() / excess_returns.std()
        return -sharpe_ratio  # Negative for minimization
```

### Integration with Existing Components
From Stories 1.4 and 2.1 established patterns:
- **Constraint System**: Use existing PortfolioConstraints dataclass and enforcement logic
- **Transaction Costs**: Integrate with existing transaction cost modeling at 0.1% per trade
- **Performance Metrics**: Use existing PerformanceAnalytics class for Sharpe ratio, drawdown calculations
- **Rebalancing**: Integrate with monthly rebalancing scheduler and trade generation logic

**Configuration System Integration:**
```python
@dataclass
class ModelConfig:
    name: str = "lstm"
    hyperparameters: Dict = field(default_factory=lambda: {
        "sequence_length": 60,
        "hidden_size": 128,
        "num_layers": 2,
        "dropout": 0.3
    })
    constraint_config: Dict = field(default_factory=lambda: {
        "long_only": True,
        "top_k_positions": 50,
        "max_monthly_turnover": 0.20
