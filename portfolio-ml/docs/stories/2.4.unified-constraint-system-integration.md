# Story 2.4: Unified Constraint System Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** portfolio manager,
**I want** consistent constraint application across all ML approaches,
**so that** fair performance comparisons isolate model effectiveness from implementation differences.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Constraint enforcement module applies identical rules to HRP, LSTM, and GAT allocations
2. Top-k position limits (k ∈ {20, 30, 50, 75, 100}) implemented for all approaches
3. Monthly turnover tracking with ≤20% limits enforced consistently
4. Long-only constraint prevents negative weights across all model outputs
5. Transaction cost modeling (0.1% linear) applied uniformly to all approaches
6. Constraint violation logging and handling maintains portfolio feasibility

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 2.1-2.3 completion:
- HRP model (Story 2.1) implemented with basic constraint handling but needs unified integration
- LSTM model (Story 2.2) contains custom constraint logic that should be unified
- GAT model (Story 2.3) has sophisticated constraint handling through ConstrainedPortfolioLayer
- All models use existing PortfolioConstraints dataclass but apply constraints differently
- Transaction cost modeling established in Story 1.4 needs integration with new constraint engine
- Monthly rebalancing framework from Story 1.4 provides turnover calculation foundation

### Constraint System Architecture
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#machine-learning-model-architecture]

**Base Constraint Interface:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple, Any
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from enum import Enum

class ConstraintViolationType(Enum):
    LONG_ONLY = "long_only"
    TOP_K_POSITIONS = "top_k_positions"
    MAX_POSITION_WEIGHT = "max_position_weight"
    MONTHLY_TURNOVER = "monthly_turnover"
    TRANSACTION_COST = "transaction_cost"

@dataclass
class PortfolioConstraints:
    long_only: bool = True                      # No short positions
    top_k_positions: Optional[int] = None       # Maximum number of positions
    max_position_weight: float = 0.10           # Maximum single position
    max_monthly_turnover: float = 0.20          # Turnover limit
    transaction_cost_bps: float = 10.0          # Linear transaction costs
    
    # Enhanced constraint parameters
    turnover_lookback_months: int = 1           # Turnover calculation window
    violation_handling: str = "adjust"          # "warn", "adjust", "reject"
    position_ranking_method: str = "weight"     # "weight", "score", "mixed"
    cost_aware_enforcement: bool = True         # Consider transaction costs in adjustments

class ConstraintEngine:
    def __init__(self, constraints: PortfolioConstraints):
        self.constraints = constraints
        self.violation_log: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []
        
    def enforce_constraints(self, 
                          weights: pd.Series,
                          previous_weights: Optional[pd.Series] = None,
                          model_scores: Optional[pd.Series] = None) -> Tuple[pd.Series, List[Dict]]:
        """Apply all constraints and return adjusted weights with violation log."""
        
    def check_violations(self, weights: pd.Series) -> List[ConstraintViolationType]:
        """Check for constraint violations without adjustment."""
        
    def calculate_turnover(self, 
                          current_weights: pd.Series, 
                          previous_weights: pd.Series) -> float:
        """Calculate portfolio turnover between periods."""
```

### Model Integration Points
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#machine-learning-model-architecture]

**HRP Model Integration:**
- Existing HRP model in `src/models/hrp/model.py` requires constraint engine integration
- Correlation-based clustering results need top-k position filtering
- Recursive bisection allocation must respect turnover limits

**LSTM Model Integration:**
- LSTM return forecasts in `src/models/lstm/model.py` need ranking-based position selection
- Sequence-to-sequence outputs require constraint-aware weight generation
- Model uncertainty scores can inform position ranking methods

**GAT Model Integration:**
- Existing ConstrainedPortfolioLayer in GAT implementation provides foundation
- Attention weights can inform position ranking and constraint prioritization
- End-to-end Sharpe optimization must incorporate constraint penalties

### File Location Guidelines
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#repository-structure-and-organization]

**Module Structure:**
- Enhanced constraint system: `src/models/base/constraints.py` (ENHANCE - existing file)
- Constraint engine: `src/models/base/constraint_engine.py` (NEW - Task 1.2)
- Turnover tracking: `src/evaluation/backtest/turnover_tracker.py` (NEW - Task 3.1)
- Violation handling: `src/models/base/violation_handler.py` (NEW - Task 6.1)
- Model integrations: Enhance existing model files in respective directories

### Integration with Existing Components
From Stories 1.4 and 2.1-2.3 established patterns:
- **Transaction Costs**: Use existing TransactionCostModel from `src/evaluation/backtest/transaction_costs.py`
- **Performance Metrics**: Integrate with existing PerformanceAnalytics from `src/evaluation/metrics/returns.py`
- **Rebalancing**: Use existing RebalancingEngine from `src/evaluation/backtest/rebalancing.py`
- **Data Loading**: Integrate with PortfolioDataLoader and parquet pipeline
- **Configuration**: Extend existing configuration system with constraint-specific parameters

### Technical Constraints
- **Memory Usage**: Constraint enforcement must operate within existing GPU memory limits
- **Performance**: Constraint checking and adjustment must complete within seconds per rebalancing
- **Consistency**: Identical constraint application across HRP, LSTM, and GAT models
- **Flexibility**: Support for different constraint configurations per model/experiment
- **Logging**: Comprehensive violation tracking for analysis and debugging

## Testing

### Testing Standards and Framework
Based on established patterns from Stories 1.4 and 2.1-2.3:

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_constraint_engine.py`, `tests/unit/test_turnover_tracking.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_unified_constraints.py`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- pytest ≥7.4.0 with coverage reporting
- pytest-xdist for parallel testing
- Mock/patch for model integration testing
- Sample data fixtures for reproducible constraint testing

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
1. **Constraint Engine Tests**: Test individual constraint enforcement and combined constraint application
2. **Model Integration Tests**: Validate constraint application across HRP, LSTM, and GAT models
3. **Turnover Tracking Tests**: Test turnover calculation accuracy and enforcement logic
4. **Violation Handling Tests**: Test violation detection, classification, and remediation
5. **Performance Tests**: Validate constraint enforcement performance within time limits
6. **Edge Case Tests**: Test constraint behavior with extreme weights, empty portfolios, etc.
