5. GPU acceleration leverages existing GAT framework with memory optimization

                 input_features: int,
                 hidden_dim: int = 64,
                 num_attention_heads: int = 8,
                 num_layers: int = 3,
                 dropout: float = 0.3,
                 edge_feature_dim: int = 3,         # [ρ, |ρ|, sign]
                 constraint_layer: bool = True):    # Enforce constraints in network
        
        # Multi-layer GAT backbone
        self.gat_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            GATLayer(input_features if i == 0 else hidden_dim,
                    hidden_dim,
                    num_attention_heads,
                    dropout,
                    edge_feature_dim) 
            for i in range(num_layers)
        ])
```

**Forward Pass with Portfolio Constraints:**
```python
def forward(self,
            node_features: torch.Tensor,      # [N, F] asset features
            edge_index: torch.Tensor,         # [2, E] graph edges
            edge_attr: torch.Tensor,          # [E, 3] edge attributes
            asset_mask: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:  # [N] valid assets
    
    # Multi-layer GAT processing with residual connections
    x = node_features
    for layer in self.gat_layers:
        x_new = layer(x, edge_index, edge_attr)
        x = x + x_new if x.size() == x_new.size() else x_new  # Residual
        x = F.dropout(x, self.dropout, training=self.training)
    
    # Portfolio weight prediction with constraints
    raw_weights = self.output_layer(x)
    portfolio_weights = self.constraint_layer(raw_weights, asset_mask)
    
    return portfolio_weights
```

### Graph Construction Pipeline Requirements
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#graph-construction-pipeline]

**Graph Configuration Specification:**
```python
@dataclass
class GraphBuildConfig:
    lookback_days: int = 252                    # Rolling correlation window
    correlation_threshold: float = 0.3          # Edge inclusion threshold
    max_edges_per_node: int = 20               # k-NN parameter
    graph_type: str = "knn"                    # "knn", "mst", "tmfg"
    edge_features: List[str] = field(
        default_factory=lambda: ["correlation", "abs_correlation", "sign"]
    )
```

### File Location Guidelines
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#repository-structure-and-organization]

**Module Structure (Leveraging Existing Assets):**
- Enhanced GAT architecture: `src/models/gat/model.py` (NEW - Main portfolio model interface)
- Existing GAT implementation: `src/models/gat/gat_model.py` (ENHANCE - Add portfolio optimizations)
- Existing graph construction: `src/models/gat/graph_builder.py` (ENHANCE - Dynamic universe support)
- Memory-efficient training: `src/models/gat/training.py` (NEW - GPU optimization)
- Base portfolio interface: `src/models/base/portfolio_model.py` (EXISTING from Stories 1.4-2.2)
- Constraints system: `src/models/base/constraints.py` (EXISTING from Stories 1.4-2.2)

### GPU Memory Management Requirements
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#gpu-architecture-and-memory-management]

**Memory Optimization Strategy:**
```python
class GPUMemoryManager:
    def __init__(self, max_vram_gb: float = 11.0):  # Conservative 11GB limit
        self.max_memory = max_vram_gb * 1024**3
        
    def optimize_batch_size(self, 
                           model: nn.Module,
                           sample_input: Tuple[torch.Tensor, ...]) -> int:
        """Determine optimal batch size for memory constraints."""
        
    def gradient_checkpointing_wrapper(self, model: nn.Module) -> nn.Module:
        """Apply gradient checkpointing to reduce memory usage."""
        
    def mixed_precision_training(self, model: nn.Module) -> Tuple[nn.Module, torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler]:
        """Enable mixed precision training for memory efficiency."""
```

**Memory Usage Estimation:**
- Model parameters: ~50MB for 3-layer GAT with 64 hidden dimensions
- Graph processing: ~200MB for 400 assets with 8000 edges (k=20)
- Gradient memory: ~50MB (same as parameters)
- Optimizer states: ~100MB (Adam with momentum)
- Activation memory: ~500MB (batch_size=32, gradient checkpointing)
- **Total estimated: ~900MB per training batch** (well within 11GB limit)

### Integration with Existing Components

### Data Integration Requirements
From Stories 1.2-1.4 established infrastructure:
- **Universe Management**: Use existing UniverseCalendar class for dynamic membership handling
- **Data Loading**: Integrate with PortfolioDataLoader and parquet pipeline
- **Returns Data**: Load from `data/processed/returns_daily.parquet` with proper temporal alignment
- **Graph Construction**: Create correlation matrices from 252-day rolling windows

### Technical Specifications

**GAT Network Configuration:**

    hidden_dim: int = 64                          # GAT hidden dimensions
    num_layers: int = 3                           # Number of GAT layers
    num_attention_heads: int = 8                  # Multi-head attention
    dropout: float = 0.3                          # Dropout rate
    edge_feature_dim: int = 3                     # Edge attribute dimensions
    learning_rate: float = 0.001                  # Adam optimizer learning rate
    weight_decay: float = 1e-5                    # L2 regularization
    batch_size: int = 32                          # Training batch size
    epochs: int = 200                             # Maximum training epochs
    patience: int = 20                            # Early stopping patience
```

**Sharpe Ratio Optimization Loss:**
```python
class SharpeRatioLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, risk_free_rate: float = 0.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.risk_free_rate = risk_free_rate
    
    def forward(self, portfolio_weights: torch.Tensor, 
                returns: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Compute negative Sharpe ratio as loss for direct optimization."""
        portfolio_returns = torch.sum(portfolio_weights * returns, dim=1)
        excess_returns = portfolio_returns - self.risk_free_rate
        sharpe_ratio = excess_returns.mean() / (excess_returns.std() + 1e-8)
        return -sharpe_ratio  # Negative for minimization
```
