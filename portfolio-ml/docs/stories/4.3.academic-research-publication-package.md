### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**STRONG PERFORMANCE (85/100 Quality Score)**

**Security: PASS**
- ✅ Appropriate MIT open source licensing implemented
- ✅ No credential exposure in reproduction scripts  
- ✅ Safe documentation practices throughout
- ✅ Community contribution guidelines include security considerations

**Performance: CONCERNS**
