# Story 1.3: Multi-Source Data Pipeline with Gap Filling

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** portfolio manager,  
**I want** clean, gap-filled daily price and volume data from Stooq and Yahoo Finance,  
**so that** ML models train on consistent, high-quality datasets without missing data artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Stooq integration retrieves daily OHLCV data for all S&P MidCap 400 constituents
2. Yahoo Finance fallback handles data gaps and provides missing historical periods
3. Gap-filling algorithm interpolates missing prices using forward/backward fill with volume validation
4. Data normalization produces clean daily returns and adjusted volume panels
5. Parquet storage format optimized for efficient loading during model training and backtesting
6. Data quality validation reports identify and flag problematic securities or time periods

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion: 
- Wikipedia scraping and universe construction established with `src/data/collectors/wikipedia.py` and `src/data/processors/universe_builder.py`
- Data collectors already partially implemented (`stooq.py`, `yfinance.py`) with session management and multi-threading
- Configuration system integrated with `CollectorConfig` and `UniverseConfig` classes
- Universe-aware data loading functionality established in `src/data/loaders/portfolio_data.py`
- Comprehensive testing framework with unit and integration tests in place

### Data Models and Configuration 
[Source: src/config/data.py]
```python
@dataclass
class CollectorConfig:
    """Data collector configuration for external data sources."""
    source_name: str
    rate_limit: float = 1.0
    timeout: int = 30
    retry_attempts: int = 3
    retry_delay: float = 1.0

@dataclass
class ValidationConfig:
    """Data validation configuration."""
    missing_data_threshold: float = 0.1  # 10%
    price_change_threshold: float = 0.5   # 50%
    volume_threshold: int = 1000
    validate_business_days: bool = True
    fill_method: str = "forward"

@dataclass
class FeatureConfig:
    """Feature engineering configuration."""
    return_periods: list[int] = [1, 5, 21, 63]
    volatility_window: int = 21
    momentum_periods: list[int] = [21, 63, 252]
    correlation_window: int = 252
    outlier_threshold: float = 3.0
```

### Storage Architecture and File Locations
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#data-architecture]
**Parquet Storage Schema:**
```python
# prices.parquet schema
prices_schema = {
    "date": "datetime64[ns]",       # Trading date index
    "ticker_*": "float64"           # One column per ticker (wide format)
}
```

**File Structure (from established project):**
- Data collectors: `src/data/collectors/` (stooq.py, yfinance.py already exist)
- Data processors: `src/data/processors/` (create gap_filling.py)
- Data loaders: `src/data/loaders/` (create parquet_manager.py)
- Configuration: `src/config/data.py` (ValidationConfig extends)
- Output storage: `data/processed/` (prices.parquet, volume.parquet, returns_daily.parquet)

### Data Pipeline Architecture
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#data-architecture]
```
Universe Calendar → Multi-Source Collection → Gap Filling → Quality Assurance → Parquet Storage
```

**Multi-Source Strategy:**
- Primary: Stooq API for comprehensive OHLCV data
- Fallback: Yahoo Finance for gap filling and missing historical periods
- Quality: Data alignment engine validates consistency between sources
- Storage: Monthly partitioned Parquet with GZIP compression

### Integration Requirements
- Universe integration: Use dynamic universe calendar from Story 1.2 `UniverseBuilder`
- Configuration: Leverage existing `CollectorConfig` and extend `ValidationConfig`
- Data loading: Integrate with existing `PortfolioDataLoader` class
- Testing: Follow established testing patterns from Story 1.2 implementation

### Technical Constraints
- **GPU Memory**: Processing must fit within RTX GeForce 5070Ti (12GB VRAM) constraints
- **Time Period**: Handle 2016-2024 evaluation period with ~400 assets
- **Performance**: Parquet I/O optimized for analytical workloads with columnar storage
- **Dependencies**: PyArrow ≥12.0.0, yfinance ≥0.2.18, requests ≥2.31.0 [Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#dependencies]
