# Story 3.1: Rolling Backtest Engine Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** quantitative researcher,
**I want** rolling backtest engine with strict no-look-ahead validation,
**so that** performance evaluation mirrors realistic deployment conditions and avoids data snooping.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Rolling window implementation maintains 36-month training / 12-month validation / 12-month testing protocol
2. Walk-forward analysis advances monthly with proper data isolation between periods

4. Temporal data integrity prevents any future information leakage into model training
5. Backtest execution tracks all portfolio positions, trades, and performance metrics over time

### Rolling Backtest Engine Architecture
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#evaluation-and-backtesting-framework]

**Core Backtest Configuration:**
```python
@dataclass
class BacktestConfig:
    start_date: pd.Timestamp
    end_date: pd.Timestamp
    training_months: int = 36                   # 3-year training window
    validation_months: int = 12                 # 1-year validation
    test_months: int = 12                       # 1-year out-of-sample test
    step_months: int = 12                       # Annual walk-forward
    rebalance_frequency: str = "M"              # Monthly rebalancing
```

**Rolling Window Implementation Framework:**
```python
class RollingBacktestEngine:
    def __init__(self, config: BacktestConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.results_cache = {}
        
    def run_backtest(self, 
                    models: Dict[str, PortfolioModel],
                    data: Dict[str, pd.DataFrame]) -> BacktestResults:
        
        # Generate rolling windows with strict temporal separation
        windows = self._generate_rolling_windows()
        
        results = {}
        for window_idx, (train_period, val_period, test_period) in enumerate(windows):
            
            # Train models on historical data only
            for model_name, model in models.items():
                model.fit(data["returns"], 
                         universe=data["universe"], 
                         fit_period=train_period)
                
                # Validate on out-of-sample validation period
                val_results = self._validate_model(model, val_period, data)
                
                # Test on final out-of-sample period
                test_results = self._test_model(model, test_period, data)
                
                results[f"{model_name}_window_{window_idx}"] = {
                    "validation": val_results,
                    "test": test_results
                }
                
        return BacktestResults(results)
```

### Performance Analytics Integration
[Source: docs/technical-architecture.md#performance-analytics-suite]

**Performance Metrics Framework:**
```python
class PerformanceAnalytics:
    @staticmethod
    def sharpe_ratio(returns: pd.Series, risk_free_rate: float = 0.0) -> float:
        """Annualized Sharpe ratio with bias correction."""
        excess_returns = returns - risk_free_rate/252  # Daily risk-free rate
        return np.sqrt(252) * excess_returns.mean() / excess_returns.std()
    
    @staticmethod
    def information_ratio(portfolio_returns: pd.Series, 
                         benchmark_returns: pd.Series) -> float:
        """Information ratio vs benchmark."""
        active_returns = portfolio_returns - benchmark_returns
        return np.sqrt(252) * active_returns.mean() / active_returns.std()
    
    @staticmethod
    def maximum_drawdown(returns: pd.Series) -> Tuple[float, pd.Timestamp, pd.Timestamp]:
        """Maximum drawdown with start and end dates."""
        cumulative = (1 + returns).cumprod()
        running_max = cumulative.expanding().max()
        drawdown = (cumulative - running_max) / running_max
        
        max_dd = drawdown.min()
        max_dd_date = drawdown.idxmin()
        
        # Find start of drawdown period
        prior_peak = running_max.loc[:max_dd_date].idxmax()
        
        return max_dd, prior_peak, max_dd_date
```

### Integration with Existing Components
From Stories 1.4, 2.1-2.5 established patterns:
- **Base Portfolio Models**: All models inherit from PortfolioModel with unified .fit() and .predict_weights() methods
- **Constraint System**: Integration with UnifiedConstraintEngine from Story 2.4
- **Data Pipeline**: Use existing PortfolioDataLoader and parquet data management

- **GPU Management**: Leverage existing MemoryEfficientTrainer from Story 2.5

### Technical Constraints and Requirements
- **Temporal Integrity**: Strict enforcement of no-look-ahead bias across all validation splits
- **Memory Usage**: Backtest execution must handle full evaluation period (2016-2024) within system constraints
- **Model Compatibility**: Must work with HRP, LSTM, and GAT models from Epic 2
- **Performance**: Full backtest execution within reasonable time limits for research purposes
- **Reproducibility**: Results must be exactly reproducible across different execution environments
