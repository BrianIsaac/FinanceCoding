## Computational Bottleneck Analysis

### Memory Constraints

- **Scaling Impact**: Quadratic memory growth for graph models (GAT)
- **Bottleneck**: Attention mechanism memory O(nÂ²) for n assets
- **Immediate Need**: Memory optimization for larger universes

### Processing Time Limitations
- **GAT Training**: 6 hours per fold limits experimentation velocity
- **LSTM Optimization**: 4-hour training cycles slow hyperparameter tuning
- **Backtest Duration**: 8-hour maximum for full backtests creates workflow constraints
- **Real-time Constraints**: Monthly rebalancing requires <10-minute execution

### Computational Efficiency Gaps
1. **GPU Utilization**: Sub-optimal batch processing (60-70% GPU utilization)
2. **Parallel Processing**: Limited multi-GPU implementation
3. **Data Pipeline**: I/O bottlenecks in data loading (5-minute dataset preparation)

- **Market Data Frequency**: Daily (target: intraday for higher-frequency rebalancing)

### Data Quality Gaps
1. **Missing Fundamental Data**: 40% of assets lack comprehensive fundamentals
2. **Corporate Actions**: Limited adjustment for splits, dividends, spin-offs
3. **Survivorship Bias**: Historical universe construction issues
4. **Data Latency**: 1-day lag in fundamental updates

### Coverage Limitations
1. **Geographic Scope**: US-only (target: global markets)
2. **Asset Classes**: Equity-only (target: multi-asset)
3. **Alternative Data**: No satellite, sentiment, or supply chain data
4. **ESG Integration**: No environmental, social, governance metrics
