    "# Methods to Gather Comprehensive Unstructured Financial News\n",
    "\n",
    "Public news APIs (e.g. MarketAux, NewsAPI) have limited coverage due to licensing, source restrictions, and API call caps. For full daily financial news, we can consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Paid News Aggregator APIs with Full Feeds\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples**: Bloomberg Terminal API, Refinitiv (Reuters) Eikon API, FactSet, S&P Capital IQ\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Near-complete coverage, structured metadata, company tagging\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Very expensive (institution-level subscriptions, thousands per month)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Direct Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case**: Scrape financial news websites (CNBC, Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ) for headlines and full articles.\n",
    "- **Tools**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium (for dynamic pages).\n",
    "- **Considerations**:\n",
    "  - Check legal and ethical compliance (Terms of Service).\n",
    "  - Implement polite scraping (rate limits, rotating proxies).\n",
    "  - Use `newspaper3k` for article text extraction from URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. RSS Feeds Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approach**:\n",
    "  - Aggregate multiple RSS feeds from financial news sites.\n",
    "  - Store and deduplicate by GUID or URL.\n",
    "  - Fetch and parse article text daily.\n",
    "- **Tools**: feedparser (Python), AWS Lambda or scheduled scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Licensed Data Vendors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case**: Institutional or professional projects.\n",
    "- **Providers**: LexisNexis, Dow Jones Factiva.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Full news archives, searchable APIs, rich metadata (tickers, topics, timestamps).\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Very high licensing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Financial Social Media and Alternative Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Include**:\n",
    "  - Stocktwits API\n",
    "  - Twitter API (financial influencers and company news)\n",
    "  - Reddit scraping (e.g. r/investing, r/stocks)\n",
    "- **Note**: Sentiment-rich but noisier data compared to professional news.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Partnerships with News Publishers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Direct B2B licensing agreements for raw feeds (XML, JSON) with specific publishers.\n",
    "- Feasible for fintech startups or institutional funds with budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Google News or Bing News Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case**: Search queries (e.g. “site:bloomberg.com AAPL”) via Google News to aggregate links.\n",
    "- Combine with article scrapers for full text extraction.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Potential Terms of Service violations if automated at scale; risk of IP bans.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "For full daily coverage without Bloomberg or FactSet:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine **RSS feeds + direct scraping** of priority sites (Reuters, Bloomberg, CNBC, WSJ, Yahoo Finance).\n",
    "- Store all URLs and article texts with timestamps in a database (Postgres, MongoDB).\n",
    "- Run FinBERT daily on new articles.\n",

      "If you're lucky enough to notice a net-income boost from the tax bill President Trump just signed, don't rush out and spend it. For Trump giveth with one hand and taketh with the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest Trump \"tax cuts\" aren't really tax cuts in the sense that tax rates will decline from 2024 to 2025. Tax rates will mostly stay the same. But without the tax bill, tax rates would have returned to 2016 levels, and a majority of Americans would have faced higher taxes. That's because the individual income tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017 were temporary and due to expire at the end of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2017 tax rates are now permanent, which will be a big savings for some taxpayers who would have been zapped if the rates had gone back to 2016 levels. The typical taxpayer will owe about $2,600 less per year than if the 2017 tax cuts had expired. The top 1% of earners will owe $67,000 less. Lower-income families with relatively low taxes will save only about $150 per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also a few new tax cuts, such as the elimination of taxes on income from tips and overtime pay, up to certain limits. Those expire in 2029, when Trump, presumably, leaves office. The new law also increases the deductibility of state and local taxes, which will mainly benefit wealthier homeowners.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the tax-cut law makes you feel richer, don't celebrate yet. Other developments are brewing that could offset any savings from the tax cuts. Here are three factors that could raise costs for families during the next few years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trump tariffs\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump's trade war is far from over. Though he has delayed some tariffs more than once, others have gone into effect, pushing the average tax on some $3 billion worth of imports from 2.5% to around 15%. That's real money US importers pay upfront, then pass on to their customers, all the way to ordinary consumers buying products from retailers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people wonder why the Trump tariffs haven't shown up yet as higher prices, given that Trump started imposing new tariffs all the way back in February. The answer is inventories. Importers saw the tariffs coming and massively stocked up in the first quarter. Imports surged in the first quarter, then plunged in the second. That led to large inventories of pre-tariff goods and much smaller inventories of costlier post-tariff goods. Prices will rise as pre-tariff inventories run out and post-tariff products hit the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drop Rick Newman a note, take his weekly economy quiz, or sign up for his newsletter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yale Budget Lab estimates that at current levels, the Trump tariffs will push inflation about 1.7 percentage points higher, costing the typical family about $2,300 per year. That's almost as much as the Trump tax cuts will supposedly save the average family. Some consumers won't notice the higher costs. Those who will notice are most likely lower-income shoppers who need the imported goods hit hardest by tariffs, including clothes, shoes, backpacks, electronics, and auto parts. By the end of the year, the higher costs imposed by the Trump tariffs should be evident at a retailer near you.\n",

      "\n",
      "They Hide What You Want\n",

      "Many retailers put the high-demand items in the back of their stores, knowing that customers will walk around the stores to find those items. While it may sound inconvenient to walk to the back of the store to get what you want, it's done by design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Business owners know that if you spend more time walking in their store, you may pick up some extra items that you didn't plan on buying. It's similar to how people have an idea of what they want when they go to a grocery store. However, if the thing they want is in the back of the store, they may have to walk through the snack aisle to get what they want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure enough, it's common for people to walk out of the grocery store with a bunch of things they didn't plan to buy. Walking into a grocery store with a clear list can help you avoid grabbing extra food.\n",

      "Trending: It’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $250 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here’s how everyday investors are getting started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Draw You In With A Lower Offer\n",
      "\n",
      "Tilbury then mentioned that many businesses use a low-priced offer to attract potential customers. Low offers make it more feasible for someone to do business with you. Auto dealers may tout long-term loans that reduce monthly payments but result in extra interest and fees in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also use a lower offer to make a mid-tier price more attractive. For instance, if a small box of fries costs $4 and a large box of fries costs $5, some people may rationalize paying the extra dollar to get more fries, even if the small box of fries would have been sufficient.\n",

      "The Second-Quarter: Getting Used to Uncertainty The second quarter of 2025 represented a remarkable turnaround from a down first quarter. The second quarter did not start well, as adverse reaction to President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs sent the Nasdaq Composite into bear-market territory and the S&P 500 into a deep correction. Yet both selloffs proved to be short-lived, as the White House immediately began pausing and/or softening proposed tariffs while also backing off attacks on Fed independence. Investors fearful that the proposed tariffs could pitch the U.S. economy into recession had a new concern as the quarter unfolded. The 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' signed by the president on July 4 likely will trigger severe escalation in the U.S. deficit over the coming decade, as spending reductions in safety-net programs are insufficient to pay for new and renewed tax cuts, higher defense spending, and higher immigration-enforcement spending. Despite the familiar threat of tariffs and new concerns about U.S. deficits, stocks rallied in 2Q25. Sharp 1Q25 earnings growth underscored the strengths of corporate America. Jobs growth and unemployment surprised to the upside, signaling that fully employed consumers could withstand current challenges. Multiple companies signaled that they could live with tariffs at approximately the current level of 10%-15% across all imports. As well, second-quarter GDP growth appears to be on track to rebound from 1Q25's negative number. A review of markets, interest rates, and the economy in the second quarter of 2025 underscores the strengths and weaknesses that the U.S. economy will bring to bear as the world adjusts to trade wars and eventually moves beyond them. Second-Quarter Review Following a more-than 23% gain in 2024, the S&P 500 declined 4.8% in the first quarter of 2025 on fears of pending tariffs and disruptions from DOGE cuts. Stocks bounced back sharply in 2Q25, with the S&P 500 rising 10.6% -- the best second-quarter performance since 2020 and the best performance in any quarter since 4Q23. Stocks in the second quarter recovered from a near bear market in mid-April, which was caused by concerns that steep 'Liberation Day' tariffs would slam economic growth. During a wild April, the blue-chip index fell 12% by 4/8/25 and, at one point, was down nearly 20% from the early February high. Based on bargain buying in the final week of April, the index finished with a 0.8% decline for the month. The S&P 500 rose by 6.2% in May, as individual-nation trade deals, including with China, lessened the feared impact of tariffs. The broad market then rose 5.1% during an eventful June, which included the One Big Beautiful Bill Act going before Congress, a mid-month Fed meeting, the Israeli-Iran war, and U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites. By month's end, investors, along with CEOs and consumers, had concluded that tariffs were survivable and that deficits in the 'big bill' would be at least partly offset by tax breaks. The Nasdaq Composite, which more than doubled the S&P 500's decline in 1Q25, nearly doubled the index gain in 2Q25 and rose 17.8% for the quarter. As of mid-year, capital appreciation on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite was identical at 5.5%. The blue-chip DJIA advanced 3.6% in the first half. In 2024, solid economic growth and falling inflation gave the Fed room to cut interest rates by a total of 100 basis points across its fall 2024 FOMC meetings. Fears that tariffs and higher deficits could rekindle inflation have kept the Fed on the sidelines so far in 2025. The Fed made no change in the fed funds target rate at its June FOMC meeting, in keeping with earlier 2025 meetings. The Trump administration earlier this year chided the Fed to cut rates, but then backed off on concerns that the attack on Fed independence was hurting the bond market and the dollar. But now, the Trump White House (emboldened by benign May CPI data and dovish commentary from two fed officials) has renewed its demand that the Fed cut rates immediately. That said, language from the Fed following the June FOMC meeting signaled no such intent. The central bank reduced its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 1.4% from 1.7%, after having lowered the GDP outlook from 2.1% following the March FOMC meeting. The Fed raised its unemployment rate forecast to 4.5% exiting 2025, from an earlier 4.4% (and an initial 4.3%). Most meaningfully, Fed members forecast core PCE inflation of 3.1% exiting 2025, raised from 2.8% in March and up from 2.5% at the beginning of 2025. Fed Chair Powell commented that 'someone has to pay for tariffs.' Perhaps because many planned tariffs are on pause, inflation has been more benign in recent months. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core PCE Price Index, edged up 0.1% in May after rising 0.2% in April. The annual change of 2.7%, however, has moved little from 2.7% in July 2024. Bond investors are concerned that the 'big bill' could cause deficits to spike, and that fear prompted long-maturity interest rates to move higher across April and May. Long rates came down in June, however, on safe-haven investing amid the Israeli-Iran war and U.S. response. The 10-year Treasury yield was 4.29% as of the end of June 2025, compared with 4.41% as of the end of May 2025; the cycle peak was 4.9% in October 2023. The two-year Treasury yield was 3.73% as of the end of June 2025, vs. 3.83% as of the end of May; the peak level was 5.2% in October 2023. The U.S. employment economy delivered a strong finish to the second quarter of 2025. U.S nonfarm payrolls rose a better-than-consensus 147,000 in June, driven by surprising strength from the public sector (state and local government). Revisions to prior months lifted three-month average jobs growth to 150,000, below the full-year 2024 average of 166,000. The unemployment rate was 4.1% for June compared with 4.2% for May. The low-4% level has prevailed for most of 2025 to date, with the U.S. employment economy in a 'low-fire, low-hire' phase. Over 250,000 federal employees let go by DOGE are still on severance and thus not yet listed as unemployed. The quality of jobs is perceived as weakening, with little growth in higher-wage areas including manufacturing and construction in May and most growth coming from lower-wage areas such as healthcare and services. Average hourly earnings grew 3.7% annually in June, down from 3.9% year over year in May. Industrial production slipped 0.2% in May, following no change in April and a 0.3% decline in March. Capacity utilization of 77.4% as of May 2025 was 2.2 percentage points below the long-run average. The ISM manufacturing PMI ticked down to 48.5 for May from 48.7 for April, after hitting a low of 47.9 for March. Purchasing managers anticipate that tariffs will incentivize companies to shift from overseas manufacturing to onshore production, but timing of such shifts is uncertain. The ISM services PMI contracted in May for the first time since June 2024, but at 49.9 remained just a fraction below the 50 level demarcating contraction from expansion. The NFIB's small business optimism index, which reached a six-year high of 105.1 in December 2024, has been declining amid on-again, off-again tariff policy. The NFIB index bounced to 98.8 in May, back above its 51-year average of 98.0 after two straight months below that level. Overall U.S. retail sales for May fell 0.9% month over month, after declining 0.1% for April. Retail sales were up 3.3% annually from May 2024. Although consumers remain concerned that tariffs could cause higher inflation, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index steadied month over month in May at 52.2 and then surged to 60.7 in June, for its first increase in six months.

      "\n",
      "Despite mounting headwinds and technical signals flashing red, RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said the recent Tesla sell-off has gone too far. In a new note to clients, Narayan reiterated his Outperform rating and raised his price target to $319, up from $307. That implies about 7% upside from current levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We believe there is strong demand for Tesla products even in the face of more EV competition,\" Narayan wrote. \"Tesla's lead, profits, cash generation, and currency are a major advantage that helps it to fund growth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "RBC values Tesla's core car business at 1x sales but gives premium weight to its long-term plays like Megapack energy storage systems, autonomous driving, and AI. The firm applies a 15x multiple to 2040 estimated EBITDA for Megapacks and a 10x revenue multiple to Tesla's future robotaxi and humanoid robot operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long-term picture, Narayan argued, justifies holding through the current rough patch. But not everyone is buying it.\n",

      "Tesla's stock has dropped over 20% year over year. According to Adam Turnquist, LPL Financial's chief technical strategist, short-term technical indicators suggest further dips for the stock.

      "Tesla's recent financials haven't helped sentiment. Tesla reported in Q2 that it sold 384,122 cars, a 13.5% drop year over year. Declining EV demand and CEO Elon Musk's political foray have led to boycotts and protests, making some analysts skeptical of a near-term rebound for the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, Narayan sees opportunity. RBC projects Tesla's revenue will rebound to $111 billion by 2026, up from an estimated $93.5 billion this year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to rise in that period from $1.99 in 2025 to $2.99 in 2026. Those gains would be fueled by expanding production, new product launches, and higher-margin growth from non-automotive businesses.\n",

      "Narayan also pointed to a potential boost from Tesla's robotaxi, which could reinvigorate investor enthusiasm around its full self-driving ambitions. \"Tesla is EV's poster child,” RBC argued.

    "[Topic modeling](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/topic-modeling?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is an **unsupervised natural language processing (NLP) technique** that uncovers hidden themes or \"topics\" within a collection of documents without requiring labeled data. It identifies clusters of words that frequently co-occur, revealing underlying themes in your text corpus.\n",

    "- **Dynamic Topic Models**: captures how topics evolve over time\n",
    "- **BERTopic**: uses transformer embeddings and class-based TF-IDF for modern, coherent topic extraction\n",
