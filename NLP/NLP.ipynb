    "# Methods to Gather Comprehensive Unstructured Financial News\n",
    "\n",
    "Public news APIs (e.g. MarketAux, NewsAPI) have limited coverage due to licensing, source restrictions, and API call caps. For full daily financial news, we can consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Paid News Aggregator APIs with Full Feeds\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples**: Bloomberg Terminal API, Refinitiv (Reuters) Eikon API, FactSet, S&P Capital IQ\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Near-complete coverage, structured metadata, company tagging\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Very expensive (institution-level subscriptions, thousands per month)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Direct Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case**: Scrape financial news websites (CNBC, Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ) for headlines and full articles.\n",
    "- **Tools**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium (for dynamic pages).\n",
    "- **Considerations**:\n",
    "  - Check legal and ethical compliance (Terms of Service).\n",
    "  - Implement polite scraping (rate limits, rotating proxies).\n",
    "  - Use `newspaper3k` for article text extraction from URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. RSS Feeds Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approach**:\n",
    "  - Aggregate multiple RSS feeds from financial news sites.\n",
    "  - Store and deduplicate by GUID or URL.\n",
    "  - Fetch and parse article text daily.\n",
    "- **Tools**: feedparser (Python), AWS Lambda or scheduled scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Licensed Data Vendors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case**: Institutional or professional projects.\n",
    "- **Providers**: LexisNexis, Dow Jones Factiva.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Full news archives, searchable APIs, rich metadata (tickers, topics, timestamps).\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Very high licensing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Financial Social Media and Alternative Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Include**:\n",
    "  - Stocktwits API\n",
    "  - Twitter API (financial influencers and company news)\n",
    "  - Reddit scraping (e.g. r/investing, r/stocks)\n",
    "- **Note**: Sentiment-rich but noisier data compared to professional news.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Partnerships with News Publishers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Direct B2B licensing agreements for raw feeds (XML, JSON) with specific publishers.\n",
    "- Feasible for fintech startups or institutional funds with budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Google News or Bing News Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case**: Search queries (e.g. “site:bloomberg.com AAPL”) via Google News to aggregate links.\n",
    "- Combine with article scrapers for full text extraction.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Potential Terms of Service violations if automated at scale; risk of IP bans.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "For full daily coverage without Bloomberg or FactSet:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine **RSS feeds + direct scraping** of priority sites (Reuters, Bloomberg, CNBC, WSJ, Yahoo Finance).\n",
    "- Store all URLs and article texts with timestamps in a database (Postgres, MongoDB).\n",
    "- Run FinBERT daily on new articles.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**\n",
    "- **NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization)**\n",
    "- **HDP (Hierarchical Dirichlet Process)**: automatically infers the number of topics\n",
    "- **PAM (Pachinko Allocation Model)**: models topic correlations\n",
    "- **Dynamic Topic Models**: captures how topics evolve over time\n",
    "- **BERTopic**: uses transformer embeddings and class-based TF-IDF for modern, coherent topic extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular libraries include **Gensim** for efficient LDA, NMF, and LSI, and **BERTopic** for transformer-based approaches.\n",

    "1. Scrape and store daily articles (we’ve handled this).\n",
    "2. Preprocess (tokenize, remove stop words, lemmatize).\n",
    "3. Build a document-term matrix.\n",
    "4. Train a topic model (e.g., LDA, BERTopic) to extract meaningful topics.\n",
    "5. Review top keywords per topic and manually label them (e.g., \"AI investing\", \"market analysis\").\n",
    "6. Track daily topic frequencies or their evolution over time using dynamic topic modeling.\n",
