# Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Finance

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning that focuses on enabling machines to process, understand, and generate human language.

In finance, a significant portion of valuable insights are embedded in unstructured textâ€”such as earnings reports, news articles, analyst commentary, regulatory filings, and customer communications. NLP allows for the systematic extraction and transformation of this textual data into structured formats suitable for analysis, modeling, and decision-making.

## Applications in Finance

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Interpreting tone and sentiment in news or social media to gauge market reaction.
- **Document Classification:** Categorising financial documents (e.g., earnings transcripts, regulatory disclosures).
- **Entity Recognition:** Identifying companies, financial instruments, key personnel, and events in text.
- **Information Extraction:** Pulling structured data (e.g., revenue, dates, risk factors) from reports and filings.
- **Topic Modeling and Clustering:** Understanding themes in analyst reports or consumer feedback.
- **Chatbot Automation:** Supporting financial customer service or advisory through conversational interfaces.

## NLP in the Machine Learning Pipeline

NLP components often serve as integral steps in broader machine learning workflows:

- **Preprocessing:** Tokenisation, normalisation, and embedding generation from raw financial text.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating numerical representations of documents for downstream tasks like classification or regression.
- **Modeling:** Training supervised or unsupervised models for tasks like fraud detection, credit scoring, or investment risk analysis.
- **Post-processing and Deployment:** Integrating NLP outputs into dashboards, alerts, or reporting tools for financial analysts and decision-makers.

This folder will contain modular implementations and experiments with various NLP techniques, tailored specifically to finance-related data and use cases.
